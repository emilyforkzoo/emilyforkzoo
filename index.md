>I believe our community is stronger when we focus on development from the bottom up. We have the responsibility to take care of the most vulnerable people first and we have the resources to do it. I’m running for City Commission to ensure that our Kalamazoo is prepared to become a more equitable society. 


E​mily and her siblings were raised in Paw Paw, Michigan. Growing up in a working class family, she learned the importance of strong communities. Working since an early age she’s worked on farms, greenhouses, restaurants, and as a caregiver for people of all ages. Her first experience with community organizing was as a high school student, when she brought students together to speak up for LGBT rights. 

After high school, Emily completed her bachelors degree in Social Work at Western Michigan University and Masters in Social Work, Communities, and Youth at the University of Michigan. Since that time, her advocacy has focused on support for immigrants, low income families, individuals with disabilities, and equity for people of color. 

Emily served as the Senior Site Coordinator for Communities In Schools at Maple Street Magnet School for The Arts. Throughout the years, she provided supports for students and families with after school programs, connection to mental and physical health services, and academic tutoring. She has also worked in the field of adult literacy and now serves as the Neighborhood Network Center Coordinator for Interfaith Homes. Outside of her professional roles, Emily has been involved with Peace Jam, Moviemento Cosecha, and leading the emergency cold weather shelters this past February.
